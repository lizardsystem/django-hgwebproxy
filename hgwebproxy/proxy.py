class HgRequestWrapper(object):
    """
    request wrapper. The main purpose of this class
    is to wrap Djangos own `Httpresponse` object, so it
    behaves largely as a `WSGI` compliant request object,
    which is what `hgweb` expects.

    `hgweb` does lot of `.write()` operations on the request
    object given, and we simply stream them into Django.

    Notice the `set_user` method, which sets the environment
    variable `REMOTE_USER` to the user you just authenticated.
    This allows `hgweb` to pick up the username as well.

    Example::
        >>> response = Httpresponseonse()
        >>> hgr = _hgrequestWrap(request, response)
        >>> hgwebdir('path to config file').run_wsgi(hgr)
        >>> print response.content
        ...
