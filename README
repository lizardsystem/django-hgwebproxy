Here are some notes on installation and configuration of hgwebproxy,
which uses Django as a proxy for hgweb. In other words, when the
request is sent to hgweb, Django gets it and relays it to hgweb, and
then intercepts the response from hgweb, and can do post-processing on
it if necessary. This has two advantages. One, hgweb can be put behind
Django auth. Secondly, this makes it possible to use Django templating
with hgweb.

hgwebproxy was written by Jesper Noehr (jesper@noehr.org), with minor
modifications by Faheem Mitha (faheem@email.unc.edu).

It has been tested with Django etch. The configuration uses Apache 2,2
and libapache2-mod-wsgi, with the following apache config. The wsgi
script is in apache/django.wsgi.

****************************************************&
WSGIScriptAlias / /var/django/hg/apache/django.wsgi

<Directory /var/django/hg/apache>
    Order deny,allow
    Allow from all
</Directory>

This application uses sqlite as the database by default, so you will
need to install python-pysqlite2 and sqlite3. Note also that the
project directory and the sqlite database file (db by default) need to
be readable and writable by the apache user (www-data for Debian). One
way of doing so is to set the group for these to www-data and make
them group writable.

The hgweb config is in hgwebproxy/hgweb.conf, and may be changed as
necessary.
